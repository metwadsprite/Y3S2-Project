####2.4   Constraints

Constraints, included in Section 2.4 of the SRS, are items that describe any properties that will limit the developers’ options.

Constraints are also sometimes called non­functional requirements because
they are requirements that the system must meet, yet they do not provide or describe functionality that   accomplishes   the   purpose   of   the   system. Design constraints can come in different forms and can influence design decisions in different ways.
There exist other types of constraint such as development resources, technical feasibility, usability and performance. We group these constraints into four categories:

• Requirement Related Constraints - limiting factors from functional requirements that define
the scope of a solution design.
• Quality Requirement Related Constraints - limiting factors from quality requirements that
define the quality of a solution, e.g. performance
and availability.
• Contextual Constraints – limiting factors that have bearings on the environment for constructing a solution, e.g. project context such as costs and schedule, technology context such as what technology platforms are mandated.
• Solution-related Constraints - limiting factors that arise during the design process. They come
from technical limitations imposed by the chosen design components, e.g. the interface format of a software component.

Therefore, the web applications will be implemented to run on the server side as much as possible. Also, it is required to test the application using different platforms, connection speeds, screen settings, colors/graphics, and browsers.

 1: The system shall be in compliance with all Accessibility, Web Design, and Security Policies applicable.

 2:The system shall use the current corporate standard Microsoft SQL Server database engine.     

 3: Database Design: The database structure should be as complete as possible during the design stage but there should be a room for modification without a large overhaul during later phases.

 4:  Portability: The application codes generated during prototyping may not run properly When re-hosting the data system to a non-Windows OS or transferring the data system to another location.

 5:  As part of standard operating procedures, a testing plan will be documented during the Design phase. The testing plan will be based on user roles, modules or use cases, required tasks and expected outcomes.

 6: The Internet connection is also a constraint for the application. Since the application  etches data from the database over the Internet, it is crucial that there is an Internet connection for the application to function.


####2.5    Assumptions and dependencies

 1: The users have sufficient knowledge of computers and android devices.

 2: It is assumed that alumni data will be made available for the project in some phase of its completion. Until then, test data will be used for providing the demo for the presentations.

 3: It is assumed that the user is familiar with an internet browser and also familiar with handling the keyboard and mouse.

 4: Since the application is a web based application there is a need for the internet browser. It will be assumed that the users will possess decent internet connectivity.

 5:The users know the English language, as the user interface will be provided in English SMS gateway services for Notification purposes  

 6:The application is used on a computer with enough performance
 ability. If the computer does not have enough performance to support the app's back-end, then there may be scenarios where the application does not work as intended. This could cause performance and usability issues for the user.
