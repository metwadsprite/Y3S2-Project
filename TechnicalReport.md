### 2.2	Product functions

The user interface is accessible through a web site with differentiated and secured access for different user roles and the data from the web site are easy to view and to locate.


The system contains the following modules: the module for data collection, the reporting module, the operations logging module.
A user of the system must be able to register through the web interface. We have three types of users (students, teachers and secretaries) having initially a predefined set of rights, allowing differentiated access to data. The user will be able to make changes, create and generate reports accordingly with the rights allocated.


The data collected by the user will be given through the web interface. The documents can be searched according to the type of file searched, after the date of creation, after the author of the document, after the content of the document.


The data will be displayed on the web page as a table. The user can save them in different formats including PDF.


The system will allow the definition of user groups and the execution of operations at group level (for example: sending emails to all group members).


Data validation will be performed in the module that implements the user interface and will generate error messages, and frequent error cases will suggest ways to resolve them.

### 2.3	User characteristics

The users of this web site are students, teachers and official representatives of a university (secretaries). Each of them have a predefined set of rights, allowing differentiated access to data.


Students use the application to see their academical situation. Each student sees here their grades for each course they took, the credits of that course, the situation of their scholarship, the situation of their college fees.


Teachers use the application to post the grades of their students. Each teacher will have an account where he can see the courses that he is teaching and the students that are taking these classes.


A secretary is an official representative of a university and she is the one that collects information about the students and makes reports with collected information.
