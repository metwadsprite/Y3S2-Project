# 1. INTRODUCTION
## 1.1 Purpose
Software design document presents the translation of software specification requirements
into a representation of software components, interfaces, and data necessary for
the implementation phase. Purpose of this document is serving as a guideline throughout development phase of the
project for developers.
## 1.2 Scope
The application's name will be GASF, from the romanian for Automatic Management of the Students in a Faculty (Gestionarea Automata a Studentilor Facultatii). This will allow the secretary to collect data of the educational planifications, study types and students, and manage it.

The informations will be supplied through a web portal and will be possible to generate reports of different faculty's situations. Them will be accessed through system interrogation.

In the end, the documents in the faculty's secretariat will be automatically managed.
